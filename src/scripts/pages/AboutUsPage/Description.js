            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Good Emporium is the comprehensive constellation for impact, philanthropy and good in a city that identifies all ecosystem actors from Non-profits, government agencies and businesses. Good Emporium allows funders and capital providers such as donors and impact investors to have a better understanding of the impact ecosystem in a city and to enable holistic and smart decision-making. As such, in their effort to catalyze social and environmental and economic well-being, funders promote transparency, accountability and collaboration within the ecosystem. </p>
            <p>Using the framework of the <a href="https://www.globalgoals.org/" target="_blank">17 Global Goals for Sustainable Development</a> and additional city-specific issues, Good Emporium is the starting and end point for funders to ensure their money is used towards measurable impact and enables organizations and individuals to work collectively towards one common goal of making a city a better, healthier and more inclusive place for all. </p>
            <p>Just like a “Food Emporium” the Good Emporium helps you find your area of interest and create connection and community. This is “Where Good Goes to Work”. </p>
            <h1>Why use the Global Goals as a framework</h1>
            <p>In September 2015, for the first time, the world agreed on a list of 17 areas to address to achieve for a better world for everyone on the planet. This agreement, referred to as  the Global Goals for Sustainable Development was developed under the auspice of the United Nations with extensive consultation with businesses, non-profit organizations, local government and individual citizens from all over the world. </p>
                <p>The Global Goals provide a common framework for all to speak the same language and understand the issues that we are addressing. Using the Global Goals framework yields to collaboration, can attract funding, tracks collective impact. SocialGood.us wants to put Austin on the world map as a city that is addressing the world's most pressing challenges from a "Think Global, Act Local" approach and offer the possibility for other cities to use the same framework. </p>
