            parked under the bridge at 12th and chicon. It had been raining. I was hungry and wanted to get to
            the truck, but my wheel chair got bogged down in the mud. I had to crawl to the truck. I was embarrassed,
            wet and dirty, but they helped me clean up, gave me dry clothes, fed me, and prayed with me.
          They treated me with dignity.”</i> — <strong>Bonnie, community first! resident</strong></div>
